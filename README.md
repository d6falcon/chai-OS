1. Design the Challenge:
Scenario and Objectives:
Define the scenario and objectives of the challenge. What do peer-to-peer participants need to achieve? For example, setting up a secure server, defending against specific attacks, or implementing security measures.
Discord Integration:
Plan how Discord will be used in the challenge. This could include receiving instructions, submitting flags, or communicating with each other.

2. Base System Configuration:
Customized LFS Base:
Follow the steps mentioned in the TO-DO to run the image. This image is based on the linux from scratch (LFS) project.

3. Security Measures:
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
Integrate an IDS such as Snort or Suricata into the system. Participants may need to configure and manage these systems to detect and respond to potential threats.
Firewall Configuration:
Include firewall settings that participants need to configure to allow or deny specific types of traffic.
Hardening:
Apply security hardening measures to the system, including disabling unnecessary services, implementing proper user permissions, and securing network services.

4. Challenges and Tasks:
Service Configuration:
Participants should set up services (web server, database, etc.) based on the challenge requirements.
Vulnerabilities:
Introduce intentional vulnerabilities that participants must find and fix. This could include misconfigurations, weak permissions, or insecure coding practices.
Capture The Flag (CTF) Elements:
Create flags that participants need to find and submit via Discord to demonstrate completion of specific challenges.

5. Discord Integration:
Bot Integration:
Use Discord bots to automate certain aspects of the challenge, such as providing hints, verifying flag submissions, and updating scores.

6. Documentation:
Instructions:
Provide clear and detailed instructions on setting up the LFS image, configuring security measures, and completing challenges.
Hints and Solutions:
Include hints for participants who may struggle with certain challenges. Provide solutions or walkthroughs after the challenge ends.

7. Testing:
Thorough Testing:
Test the entire challenge environment to ensure that everything works as expected and that vulnerabilities and flags are correctly implemented.
Beta Testing:
Consider running a beta test with a small group to identify and fix any issues before opening the challenge to a larger audience.

8. Post-Challenge:
Feedback:
Exchange feedback via Discord.
